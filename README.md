Technical approach:
-made on click functions to add topics to the current button list.
-on click used ajax call/api to retrieve the data and displayed 10 gifs in relation to the work that was selected in the topic buttons.
-looped through to append the images in the display.
-gifs to start in "still" state and animate upon click of them.
